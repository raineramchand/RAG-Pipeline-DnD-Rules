(Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\nThe Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about \\nstorytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares ele-\\nments with childhood games of make-believe. Like those \\ngames, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and \\nimagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the \\nchallenges that scene presents.\\n\\t Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the \\ncraggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east \\nand Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling \\ntowers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. \\nThey look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a \\nwide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. \\nA lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an \\narched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of \\nthe drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron \\nstraining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, \\nstone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin \\nhideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, \\nhangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of \\nCastle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into \\nthe courtyard.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the courtyard. \\n\\t Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the gargoyles. I \\nhave a feeling they’re not just statues.\\n\\t Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious? I \\nwant to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or \\nis it going to collapse under our weight?\\t\\n\\t Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to \\nthe stories, a way of determining the consequences of the \\nadventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether \\ntheir attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers \\ncan scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical \\nlightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Any-\\nthing is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more \\nprobable than others.\\n\\t Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re \\nlooking at the gargoyles?\\n\\t Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures \\nand not decorations?\\n\\t DM: Make an Intelligence check.\\n\\t Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?\\n\\t DM: Sure!'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='DM: Sure!\\n\\t Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.\\n\\t DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is \\nchecking out the drawbridge?\\n\\t In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player cre-\\nates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams \\nup with other adventurers (played by friends). Working \\ntogether, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ru-\\nined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, \\nor a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. \\nThe adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other char-\\nacters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous \\nmagic items and other treasure.\\n\\t One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon \\nMaster (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The \\nDM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate \\nits hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM \\nmight describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the \\nplayers decide what they want their adventurers to do.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Will they walk across the dangerously weathered draw-\\nbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize \\nthe chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives \\nway? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?\\n\\t Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ \\nactions and narrates what they experience. Because the \\nDM can improvise to react to anything the players at-\\ntempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can \\nbe exciting and unexpected.\\n\\t The game has no real end; when one story or quest \\nwraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing \\nstory called a campaign. Many people who play the \\ngame keep their campaigns going for months or years, \\nmeeting with their friends every week or so to pick up \\nthe story where they left off. The adventurers grow in \\nmight as the campaign continues. Each monster de-\\nfeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure \\nrecovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase \\nin power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.\\n\\t There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & \\nDragons game—at least, not the way those terms are \\nusually understood. Together, the DM and the players \\ncreate an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront \\ndeadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to \\na grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in \\nby a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can \\nsearch for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, \\nor the player might choose to create a new character to \\ncarry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure \\nsuccessfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a \\nmemorable story, they all win.\\nWorlds of Adventure\\nThe many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game \\nare places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and \\nspectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of \\nmedieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='magic that make these worlds unique.\\n\\t The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist \\nwithin a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected \\nin strange and mysterious ways to one another and to \\nother planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane \\nof Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this \\nmultiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of \\nthem have been published as official settings for the D&D \\ngame.

Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\nHow to Play\\nThe play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds ac-\\ncording to this basic pattern.\\n\\t 1. The DM describes the environment. The DM \\ntells the players where their adventurers are and what’s \\naround them, presenting the basic scope of options that \\npresent themselves (how many doors lead out of a room,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).\\n\\t 2. The players describe what they want to do. Some-\\ntimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \\n“We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, \\ndifferent adventurers do different things: one adventurer \\nmight search a treasure chest while a second examines \\nan esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps \\nwatch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, \\nbut the DM listens to every player and decides how to re-\\nsolve those actions.\\n\\t Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer \\nwants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM \\nmight just say that the door opens and describe what lies \\nbeyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might \\nhide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might \\nmake it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. \\nIn those cases, the DM decides what happens, often \\nrelying on the roll of a die to determine the results of \\nan action.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='an action.\\n\\t 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ \\nactions. Describing the results often leads to another de-\\ncision point, which brings the flow of the game right back \\nto step 1.\\n\\t This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau-\\ntiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or \\nlocked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In \\ncertain situations, particularly combat, the action is more \\nstructured and the players (and DM) do take turns choos-\\ning and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is \\nfluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the \\nadventure.\\n\\t Often the action of an adventure takes place in the \\nimagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s \\nverbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to \\nuse music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the \\nmood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different \\nvoices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other \\ncharacters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures \\nto represent each creature involved in a scene to help the \\nplayers keep track of where everyone is.\\nGame Dice\\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of \\nsides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in \\nmany bookstores.\\n\\t In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the \\nletter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, \\nd12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the \\ntypical cube that many games use).\\n\\t Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You \\ngenerate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two \\ndifferent ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die \\n(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and \\nthe other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for \\nGreyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are \\nwoven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside \\nthese worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='by generations of D&D players for their own games. And \\namid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a \\nworld of your own.\\n\\t All these worlds share characteristics, but each world \\nis set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive \\nmonsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun-\\ngeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual \\ntraits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun \\nsetting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and \\nthe elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races \\nunknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, \\nsoldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last \\nWar. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like \\nthe War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Drag-\\nonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, and you can \\nuse the rules in this book to create a character and play \\nin any one of them.\\n\\t Your DM might set the campaign on one of these'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Your DM might set the campaign on one of these \\nworlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is \\nso much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should \\ncheck with your DM about any house rules that will affect \\nyour play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is \\nthe authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the \\nsetting is a published world.\\nUsing These Rules\\nThe D&D Basic Rules document has four main parts.\\n\\t Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the rules \\nand guidance you need to make the character you’ll play \\nin the game. It includes information on the various races, \\nclasses, backgrounds, equipment, and other customiza-\\ntion options that you can choose from. Many of the rules \\nin part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.\\n\\t Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, beyond \\nthe basics described in this introduction. That part cov-\\ners the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and de-\\nscribes the three broad categories of activity in the game: \\nexploration, interaction, and combat.\\n\\t Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic \\nin the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and a \\nselection of typical spells available to magic-using charac-\\nters (and monsters) in the game.\\n\\t Part 4 is especially for the Dungeon Master. It contains \\ninstructions for how to challenge the player characters \\nwith adversaries that are a good test of their abilities, \\nplus dozens of ready-to-use monster descriptions. \\nIt also provides a sampling of magic items that the \\ncharacters can earn as their rewards for vanquishing \\nthose monsters.\\n\\t The end of the document contains supplemental mate-\\nrial. Appendix A collects all the definitions of conditions \\nthat can affect characters and monsters. Appendix B is a \\nbrief discussion of deities in the game, particularly those'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='in the Forgotten Realms setting. Appendix C describes \\nthe five factions in the Forgotten Realms that characters \\ncan become associated with. Finally, a three-page char-\\nacter sheet provides a standardized way for players to \\nrecord and keep track of their characters’ abilities and \\npossessions.\\n5\\n Introduction\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw \\nis modified by special situations called advantage and dis-\\nadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances \\nsurrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the \\nopposite. When you have either advantage or disadvan-\\ntage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use \\nthe higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use \\nthe lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if \\nyou have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, \\nyou use the 17.\\n\\t More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are \\npresented in chapter 7.\\nSpecific Beats General\\nThis book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that \\ngovern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, \\nclass features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and \\nother game elements break the general rules in some \\nway, creating an exception to how the rest of the game \\nworks. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a \\ngeneral rule, the specific rule wins.\\n\\t Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, \\nmany adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, \\nbut every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That \\ntrait creates a minor exception in the game. Other exam-\\nples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, \\nan adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but \\nsome spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most \\nof the major exceptions to the rules.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='of the major exceptions to the rules.\\nRound Down\\nThere’s one more general rule you need to know at the \\noutset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round \\ndown if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is \\none-half or greater.\\nAdventures\\nThe Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of \\ncharacters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon \\nMaster presents to them. Each character brings partic-\\nular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability \\nscores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, \\nand magic items. Every character is different, with var-\\nious strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of \\nadventurers is one in which the characters complement \\neach other and cover the weaknesses of their compan-\\nions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully \\ncomplete the adventure.\\n\\t The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with \\na beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might \\nbe created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and \\ndesires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic \\nsetting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum-\\nbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It \\nfeatures a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created \\nand played by the other players at the table, as well as \\nnonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might \\nbe patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background \\nexample, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. \\nSome ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, \\nand so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit \\nfrom the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, \\nand 00 and 0 is 100.\\n\\t When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many \\ndice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to \\nadd. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-\\nsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” \\nand “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide \\nthe number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of \\n1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending \\non whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the num-\\nber rolled is more than half the number of sides on the \\ndie, it’s a 2.)\\nThe D20\\nDoes an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just \\nbounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an \\noutrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging \\nriver? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, \\nor does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In \\ncases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the \\nDungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided \\ndie, a d20, to determine success or failure.\\n\\t Every character and monster in the game has capa-\\nbilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are \\nStrength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for \\nmost adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as \\n1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability \\nmodifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost \\nevery d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or \\nmonster’s behalf.\\n\\t Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the \\nthree main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the \\nrules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.\\n\\t 1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add \\nthe relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier de-\\nrived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes \\nincludes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s par-\\nticular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and \\nhow to determine an ability’s modifier.)\\n\\t 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A \\nclass feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some \\nother effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total \\nequals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, \\nattack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a \\nfailure. The DM is usually the one who determines target \\nnumbers and tells players whether their ability checks, \\nattack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\\n\\t The target number for an ability check or a saving \\nthrow is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target num-\\nber for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC). \\n\\t This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks \\nin D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for \\nusing the d20 in the game.\\n6\\n Introduction\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale.

Combat \\nis the most structured element of a D&D session, with'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets \\na chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, \\nthere’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to at-\\ntempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on \\na shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling \\na mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, \\nincluding allies, enemies, and neutral parties.\\nThe Wonders of Magic\\nFew D&D adventures end without something magical \\nhappening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears \\nfrequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus \\nof chapters 10 and 11.\\n\\t In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, practitioners \\nof magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people \\nby their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see \\nevidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually \\nminor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, \\na wizard walking through the streets with an animated \\nshield guardian as a bodyguard.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='shield guardian as a bodyguard.\\n\\t For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. \\nWithout the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adven-\\nturers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without \\nthe uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, war-\\nriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without \\nthe sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and \\ndruids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.\\n\\t Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven-\\ntures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who \\nare hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader \\nseeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a \\nhag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, \\na mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons \\nwith a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual \\nto rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few \\nof the magical threats that adventurers might face. With \\nmagic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the adventurers might prevail!\\nextras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain \\nwhose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action. \\n\\t Over the course of their adventures, the characters are \\nconfronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situa-\\ntions that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes \\nthe adventurers and other creatures do their best to \\nkill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the \\nadventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical \\nobject) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers \\nspend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, \\nfind something hidden, or unravel the current situation. \\nMeanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making \\ndecisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try \\nto do next.\\n\\t Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short ad-\\nventure might present only a few challenges, and it might \\ntake no more than a single game session to complete. A'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interac-\\ntions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions \\nto play through, stretching over weeks or months of real \\ntime. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the \\nadventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy \\nthe spoils of their labors.\\n\\t But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of \\nan adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made \\nup of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole \\nseries—a string of adventures joined together, with a con-\\nsistent group of adventurers following the narrative from \\nstart to finish.\\nThe Three Pillars of Adventure\\nAdventurers can try to do anything their players can \\nimagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities \\nin three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, \\nand combat.\\n\\t Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement \\nthrough the world and their interaction with objects and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='situations that require their attention. Exploration is the \\ngive-and-take of the players describing what they want \\ntheir characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling \\nthe players what happens as a result.

Choose a Class\\nEvery adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly \\ndescribes a character’s vocation, what special talents he \\nor she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely \\nto employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, \\nor engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes \\nare described in chapter 3.\\n\\t Your character receives a number of benefits from \\nyour choice of class. Many of these benefits are class \\nfeatures—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set \\nyour character apart from members of other classes. You \\nalso gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, \\nskills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your profi-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='ciencies define many of the things your character can do \\nparticularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a \\nconvincing lie.\\n\\t On your character sheet, record all the features that \\nyour class gives you at 1st level.\\nLevel\\nTypically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in \\nlevel by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). \\nA 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring \\nworld, although he or she might have been a soldier or a \\npirate and done dangerous things before.\\n\\t Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s en-\\ntry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar \\nwith the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D \\ncampaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a \\nhigher level, on the assumption that your character has \\nalready survived a few harrowing adventures.\\n\\t Record your level on your character sheet.

Your \\nhit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit \\nPoint Dice).\\nYour first step in playing an adventurer in the \\nDungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a \\ncharacter of your own. Your character is a combination \\nof game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagina-\\ntion. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and \\na class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the \\npersonality, appearance, and backstory of your character. \\nOnce completed, your character serves as your repre-\\nsentative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & \\nDragons world.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Dragons world.\\n\\t Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the \\nkind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a cou-\\nrageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a \\nflamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in \\nan unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue \\nwho likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who \\npicks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction \\nfeaturing dwarves or elves? Try building a character of \\none of those races. Do you want your character to be the \\ntoughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter \\nclass. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look \\nat the illustrations in this book to see what catches \\nyour interest.\\n\\t Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps \\nin order, making decisions that reflect the character you \\nwant. Your conception of your character might evolve \\nwith each choice you make. What’s important is that you \\ncome to the table with a character you’re excited to play.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Throughout this chapter, we use the term character \\nsheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, \\nwhether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the \\nend of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece \\nof notebook paper.

Choose a Race\\nEvery character belongs to a race, one of the many in-\\ntelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most \\ncommon player character races are dwarves, elves, \\nhalflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces, \\nsuch as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides \\nmore information about these races.\\n\\t The race you choose contributes to your character’s \\nidentity in an important way, by establishing a general'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='appearance and the natural talents gained from culture \\nand ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular ra-\\ncial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain \\nweapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the \\nability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dove-\\ntail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For \\nexample, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them \\nexceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful \\nwizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. \\nChapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters\\n9\\n Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale.

The Ability Score Summary \\ntable provides a quick reference for what qualities are \\nmeasured by each ability, what races increases which \\nabilities, and what classes consider each ability particu-\\nlarly important.\\n\\t You generate your character’s six ability scores ran-\\ndomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the \\nhighest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five \\nmore times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to \\nsave time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining \\nability scores, you can use the following scores instead: \\n15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\\n\\t Now take your six numbers and write each number \\nbeside one of your character’s six abilities to assign \\nscores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, \\nWisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to \\nyour ability scores as a result of your race choice.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='After assigning your ability scores, determine your \\nability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers \\ntable. To determine an ability modifier without consulting \\nthe table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide \\nthe result by 2 (round down).

Since he’s a fighter, he \\nputs his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-high-\\nest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash \\nfighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, \\nwiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in \\nWisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial ben-\\nefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his \\nStrength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers \\nlook like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Con-\\nstitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (–1), Wisdom 13 (+1), \\nCharisma 12 (+1).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Charisma 12 (+1).\\n\\t Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitu-\\ntion modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.\\n\\t At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die \\ntype is determined by your class. You start with hit points \\nequal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your \\nclass description. (You also add your Constitution mod-\\nifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your \\nhit point maximum.\\n\\t Record your character’s hit points on your character \\nsheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses \\nand the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you \\ncan spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in \\nchapter 8).\\nProficiency Bonus\\nThe table that appears in your class description shows \\nyour proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level \\ncharacter.

Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as \\nwell as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.\\n\\t Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die \\nroll or other number more than once.

The threats they face are rel-\\natively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads \\nor villages.\\n\\t In the second tier (levels 5–10), characters come into \\ntheir own.

For \\nthis reason, adventurers have access to a variety of ar-\\nmor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to \\ncostly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in \\nbetween. The Armor table collects the most commonly \\navailable types of armor found in the game and separates \\nthem into three categories: light armor, medium armor, \\nand heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor \\nwith a shield.\\n\\t The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other \\nproperties of the common types of armor worn in the \\nworlds of D&D.\\n\\t Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor \\nor strap a shield to an arm.

Heavier armor interferes with the wear-\\ner’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.

Even within your \\nclass and race, you have options to fine-tune what your'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='character can do. But a few players—with the DM’s per-\\nmission—want to go a step further.\\n\\t Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook defines two \\noptional sets of rules for customizing your character: \\nmulticlassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine \\nclasses together, and feats are special options you can \\nchoose instead of increasing your ability scores as you \\ngain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are \\navailable in a campaign. \\nMulticlassing\\nMulticlassing allows you to gain levels in multiple \\nclasses. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those \\nclasses to realize a character concept that might not be \\nreflected in one of the standard class options.\\n\\t With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level \\nin a new class whenever you advance in level, instead \\nof gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all \\nyour classes are added together to determine your char-\\nacter level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.\\n\\t As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain \\na member of your original class with just a few levels in \\nanother class, or you might change course entirely, never \\nlooking back at the class you left behind. You might even \\nstart progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to \\na single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice \\nsome focus in exchange for versatility.\\nPrerequisites\\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score \\nprerequisites for both your current class and your new \\none, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table \\nin the Player’s Handbook. Without the full training that \\na beginning character receives, you must be a quick \\nstudy in your new class, having a natural aptitude that \\nis reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\\nExperience Points\\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based \\non your total character level, as shown in the Character'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Advancement table in chapter 1 of this document, not \\nyour level in a particular class.\\nHit Points and Hit Dice\\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described \\nfor levels after 1st.

If the Hit Dice are \\nthe same die type, you can simply pool them together. \\nIf your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep \\ntrack of them separately.\\nProficiency Bonus\\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total \\ncharacter level, as shown in the Character Advancement \\ntable, not your level in a particular class.\\nProficiencies\\nWhen you gain a level in a class other than your first, you \\ngain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies. See \\nchapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information.\\nClass Features\\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='for that level. A few features, however, have additional \\nrules when you’re multiclassing. See chapter 6 of the \\nPlayer’s Handbook for more information.\\nFeats\\nA feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives \\na character special capabilities. It embodies training, ex-\\nperience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. See \\nchapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information.\\n\\t At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score \\nImprovement feature.

Brilliant and \\ncharming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these \\nqualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.\\n\\t The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the \\nsaving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability \\nscores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule \\nbehind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier de-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='rived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the \\ntotal to a target number.\\n\\t This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and \\nsaving throws, covering the fundamental activities that \\ncreatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls ap-\\npear in chapter 9.\\nAbility Scores and \\nModifiers\\nEach of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that \\ndefines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is \\nnot just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encom-\\npasses a creature’s training and competence in activities \\nrelated to that ability.\\n\\t A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but \\nadventurers and many monsters are a cut above average \\nin most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a per-\\nson usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high \\nas 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as \\nhigh as 30.\\n\\t Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score \\nand ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table \\nnotes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability \\nscores, from 1 to 30.\\n\\t To determine an ability modifier without consulting the \\ntable, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide \\nthe total by 2 (round down).\\n\\t Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack \\nroll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers \\ncome up in play more often than their associated scores.\\nAdvantage and \\nDisadvantage\\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you \\nhave advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a \\nsaving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you \\nroll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher \\nof the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower \\nroll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have \\ndisadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you \\ninstead have advantage and roll those numbers, you \\nuse the 17.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='use the 17.\\n\\t If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants \\nadvantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll \\nmore than one additional d20. If two favorable situations \\ngrant advantage, for example, you still roll only one addi-\\ntional d20.\\n\\t If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage \\nand disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of \\nthem, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple \\ncircumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants \\nadvantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have nei-\\nther advantage nor disadvantage.\\n\\t When you have advantage or disadvantage and some-\\nthing in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets \\nyou reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace \\nonly one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, \\nif a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability \\ncheck and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the \\nLucky trait to reroll the 1.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\\n\\t You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through \\nthe use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration \\ncan also give a character advantage (as explained in \\nchapter 4, “Personality and Background”). The DM can \\nalso decide that circumstances influence a roll in one \\ndirection or the other and grant advantage or impose dis-\\nadvantage as a result.\\nProficiency Bonus\\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, \\nas detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, \\nwhich is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is \\nused in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and \\nattack rolls.\\n\\t Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die \\nroll or other number more than once. For example, if two \\ndifferent rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to \\na Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus \\nonly once when you make the save.\\n\\t Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multi-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='plied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before \\nyou apply it.

For instance, if \\nyou lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no ben-\\nefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency \\nbonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\\n\\t In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for \\nattack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows \\nyou to do so, these same rules apply.\\nAbility Checks\\nAn ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate \\ntalent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. \\nThe DM calls for an ability check when a character or \\nmonster attempts an action (other than an attack) that \\nhas a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, \\nthe dice determine the results.\\n\\t For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six \\nabilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty \\nof the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='difficult a task, the higher its DC.

As with other d20 rolls, apply \\nbonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. \\nIf the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check \\nis a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at \\nhand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the charac-\\nter or monster makes no progress toward the objective \\nor makes progress combined with a setback determined \\nby the DM.\\nContests\\nSometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are di-\\nrectly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both \\nof them are trying to do the same thing and only one can \\nsucceed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring \\nthat has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from \\naccomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries \\nto force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. \\nIn situations like these, the outcome is determined by a \\nspecial form of ability check, called a contest.\\n\\t Both participants in a contest make ability checks \\nappropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate \\nbonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total \\nto a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The \\nparticipant with the higher check total wins the contest. \\nThat character or monster either succeeds at the action \\nor prevents the other one from succeeding.\\n\\t If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the \\nsame as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant \\nmight win the contest by default. If two characters tie in \\na contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character \\ngrabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, \\na tie means that the door remains shut.\\nSkills\\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, includ-\\ning skills that a character or a monster can be proficient \\nin. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, \\nand an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates \\na focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill pro-\\nficiencies are determined at character creation, and a \\nmonster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s \\nstat block.)\\n\\t For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a char-\\nacter’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an \\nobject, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexter-\\nity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, \\nand Stealth, respectively. So a character who has profi-\\nciency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity \\nchecks related to sneaking and hiding.\\n\\t The skills related to each ability score are shown in'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the following list.

Without proficiency in the skill, the indi-\\nvidual makes a normal ability check.\\n\\t For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dan-\\ngerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='(Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Ath-\\nletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the \\nStrength check.

Proficiency in Athletics, \\nfor example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some \\nsituations, though, your proficiency might reasonably \\napply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM \\nmight ask for a check using an unusual combination of \\nability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can ap-\\nply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you \\nhave to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, \\nyour DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your \\nDM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics \\nand ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re \\nproficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to \\nthe Constitution check just as you would normally do for \\na Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your dwarf \\nfighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an \\nenemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) \\ncheck, even though Intimidation is normally associated \\nwith Charisma.\\nPassive Checks\\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that \\ndoesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent \\nthe average result for a task done repeatedly, such as \\nsearching for secret doors over and over again, or can be \\nused when the DM wants to secretly determine whether \\nthe characters succeed at something without rolling dice, \\nsuch as noticing a hidden monster.\\n\\t Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a pas-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='sive check:\\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For \\ndisadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive \\ncheck total as a score.\\n\\t For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of \\n15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive \\nWisdom (Perception) score of 14.\\n\\t The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below \\nrely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in \\nchapter 8.\\nWorking Together\\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a \\ntask. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one \\nwith the highest ability modifier—can make an ability \\ncheck with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the \\nother characters. In combat, this requires the Help action \\n(see chapter 9).\\n\\t A character can only provide help if the task is one that \\nhe or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open \\na lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a charac-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='ter who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character \\nin that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two \\nor more individuals working together would actually be \\nproductive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no \\neasier with help.\\nGroup Checks\\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish \\nsomething as a group, the DM might ask for a group \\nability check. In such a situation, the characters who are \\nskilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.\\n\\t To make a group ability check, everyone in the group \\nmakes the ability check. If at least half the group \\nsucceeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the \\ngroup fails.\\n\\t Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re \\nmost useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a \\ngroup. For example, when adventurers are navigating a \\nswamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) \\ncheck to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. \\nIf at least half the group succeeds, the successful char-\\nacters are able to guide their companions out of danger. \\nOtherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\\nUsing Each Ability\\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt \\nin the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This \\nsection explains in more detail what those abilities mean \\nand the ways they are used in the game.\\nStrength\\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and \\nthe extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\\nStrength Checks\\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, \\npull, or break something, to force your body through a \\nspace, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. \\nThe Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of \\nStrength checks.\\n\\t Athletics.

Examples include the \\nfollowing activities:\\n•\\t You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid \\nhazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while \\nsomething is trying to knock you off.\\n•\\t You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull \\noff a stunt midjump.\\n•\\t You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur-\\nrents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. \\nOr another creature tries to push or pull you underwa-\\nter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\\n\\t Other Strength Checks.

You use me-\\nlee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand \\ncombat, and some of them can be thrown to make a \\nranged attack.\\nLifting and Carrying\\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight \\nyou can bear. The following terms define what you can \\nlift or carry.\\n\\t Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your \\nStrength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in \\npounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that \\nmost characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\\n\\t Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight \\nin pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight \\nin excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops \\nto 5 feet.\\n\\t Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more \\nweight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each \\nsize category above Medium, double the creature’s carry-\\ning capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For \\na Tiny creature, halve these weights.\\nVariant: Encumbrance\\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally sim-\\nple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed \\nrules for determining how a character is hindered by the \\nweight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore \\nthe Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5. \\n\\t If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength \\nscore, you are encumbered, which means your speed \\ndrops by 10 feet.\\n\\t If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength \\nscore, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are \\ninstead heavily encumbered, which means your speed'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability \\nchecks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, \\nDexterity, or Constitution.\\nDexterity\\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\\nDexterity Checks\\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, \\nquickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky foot-\\ning. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills \\nreflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\\n\\t Acrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers \\nyour attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such \\nas when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance \\non a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. \\nThe DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check \\nto see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including \\ndives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\\n\\t Sleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of leger-\\ndemain or manual trickery, such as planting something'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='on someone else or concealing an object on your per-\\nson, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM \\nmight also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to \\ndetermine whether you can lift a coin purse off another \\nperson or slip something out of another \\nperson’s pocket.\\n\\t Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you \\nattempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past \\nguards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on \\nsomeone without being seen or heard.\\n\\t Other Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a \\nDexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n•\\t Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\\n•\\t Steer a chariot around a tight turn\\n•\\t Pick a lock\\n•\\t Disable a trap\\n•\\t Securely tie up a prisoner\\n•\\t Wriggle free of bonds\\n•\\t Play a stringed instrument\\n•\\t Craft a small or detailed object\\nAttack Rolls and Damage\\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and \\nyour damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dex-\\nterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll \\nwhen attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse \\nproperty, such as a dagger or a rapier.\\nHiding\\nThe DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for \\nhiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) \\ncheck. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that \\ncheck’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) \\ncheck of any creature that actively searches for signs of \\nyour presence.\\n\\t You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, \\nand you give away your position if you make noise, such as \\nshouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible \\ncreature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of \\nits passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has \\nto stay quiet.\\n\\t In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger \\nall around, so if you come out of hiding and approach'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain \\ncircumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to \\nstay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, \\nallowing you to gain advantage on an attack before \\nyou are seen.\\n\\t Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance \\nsomeone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To \\ndetermine whether such a creature notices you, the DM \\ncompares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s \\npassive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the \\ncreature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses \\nor penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For \\ndisadvantage, subtract 5.\\n\\t For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency \\nbonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and \\nproficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom \\n(Perception) of 14.\\n\\t What Can You See? One of the main factors in \\ndetermining whether you can find a hidden creature or'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='object is how well you can see in an area, which might be \\nlightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8.\\n64\\n64\\n Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores \\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Initiative determines the order \\nof creatures’ turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.\\nConstitution\\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\\nConstitution Checks\\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply \\nto Constitution checks, because the endurance this abil-\\nity represents is largely passive rather than involving a \\nspecific effort on the part of a character or monster. A \\nConstitution check can model your attempt to push be-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='yond normal limits, however.\\n\\t The DM might call for a Constitution check when you \\ntry to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n•\\t Hold your breath\\n•\\t March or labor for hours without rest\\n•\\t Go without sleep\\n•\\t Survive without food or water\\n•\\t Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\\nHit Points\\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. \\nTypically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit \\nDie you roll for your hit points.\\n\\t If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point \\nmaximum changes as well, as though you had the new \\nmodifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your \\nConstitution score when you reach 4th level and your \\nConstitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you ad-\\njust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had \\nalways been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first \\nthree levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level \\nusing your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your \\nConstitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is \\nreduced by 7.\\nIntelligence\\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, \\nand the ability to reason.\\nIntelligence Checks\\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need \\nto draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive rea-\\nsoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and \\nReligion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelli-\\ngence checks.\\n\\t Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures \\nyour ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, \\neldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of exis-\\ntence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\\n\\t History. Your Intelligence (History) check mea-\\nsures your ability to recall lore about historical events, \\nlegendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, re-\\ncent wars, and lost civilizations.\\n\\t Investigation. When you look around for clues and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='make deductions based on those clues, you make an \\nIntelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the \\nlocation of a hidden object, discern from the appearance \\nof a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the \\nweakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. \\nPoring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden \\nfragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence \\n(Investigation) check.\\n\\t Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures \\nyour ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and ani-\\nmals, the weather, and natural cycles.\\n\\t Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures \\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, \\nreligious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices \\nof secret cults.\\n\\t Other Intelligence Checks. The DM might call for an \\nIntelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n•\\t Communicate with a creature without using words\\n•\\t Estimate the value of a precious item'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='•\\t Estimate the value of a precious item\\n•\\t Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\\n•\\t Forge a document\\n•\\t Recall lore about a craft or trade\\n•\\t Win a game of skill\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, \\nwhich helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells \\nthey cast.\\nWisdom\\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around \\nyou and represents perceptiveness and intuition. \\nWisdom Checks\\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body \\nlanguage, understand someone’s feelings, notice things \\nabout the environment, or care for an injured person. \\nThe Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and \\nSurvival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wis-\\ndom checks.\\n\\t Animal Handling. When there is any question whether \\nyou can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount \\nFinding a Hidden Object\\nWhen your character searches for a hidden object such as \\na secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to \\nfind hidden details or other information and clues that you \\nmight otherwise overlook.\\n\\t In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking \\nin order for the DM to determine your chance of success. \\nFor example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes \\nin the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you \\npace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for \\nclues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of \\nyour Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to \\nspecify that you were opening the drawers or searching the \\nbureau in order to have any chance of success.\\n65\\n65\\n Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores \\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether \\nyou can determine the true intentions of a creature, such \\nas when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next \\nmove. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body lan-\\nguage, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\n\\t Medicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to \\nstabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\n\\t Perception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you \\nspot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. \\nIt measures your general awareness of  \\nyour surroundings and the keenness of your senses.  \\nFor example, you might try to hear a conversation through \\na closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear \\nmonsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try \\nto spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether \\nthey are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed \\nsecret door.\\n\\t Survival. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom \\n(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide \\nyour group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that \\nowlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quick-\\nsand and other natural hazards.\\n\\t Other Wisdom Checks. The DM might call for a \\nWisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:\\n•\\t Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\\n•\\t Discern whether a seemingly dead or living crea-\\nture is undead\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nClerics use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which \\nhelps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\nCharisma\\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively \\nwith others. It includes such factors as confidence and \\neloquence, and it can represent a charming or command-\\ning personality.\\nCharisma Checks\\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='or entertain others, when you try to make an impres-\\nsion or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating \\na tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, \\nPerformance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in \\ncertain kinds of Charisma checks.\\n\\t Deception. Your Charisma (Deception) check deter-\\nmines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either \\nverbally or through your actions. This deception can \\nencompass everything from misleading others through \\nambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations in-\\nclude trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn \\nmoney through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, \\ndull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or main-\\ntain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\\n\\t Intimidation. When you attempt to influence some-\\none through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical \\nviolence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma \\n(Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry in-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='formation out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs \\nto back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of \\na broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to recon-\\nsider a decision.\\n\\t Performance. Your Charisma (Performance) check \\ndetermines how well you can delight an audience with \\nmusic, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of \\nentertainment.\\n\\t Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone \\nor a group of people with tact, social graces, or good \\nnature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma \\n(Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when \\nacting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial \\nrequests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of per-\\nsuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let \\nyour party see the king, negotiating peace between war-\\nring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\\n\\t Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a \\nCharisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like \\nthe following:'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the following:\\n•\\t Find the best person to talk to for news, \\nrumors, and gossip\\n•\\t Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics \\nof conversation\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma \\nas their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the \\nsaving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\nSaving Throws\\nA saving throw—also called a save—represents an at-\\ntempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or \\na similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a \\nsaving throw; you are forced to make one because your \\ncharacter or monster is at risk of harm.\\n\\t To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the ap-\\npropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your \\nDexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\\n\\t A saving throw can be modified by a situational \\nbonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage \\nand disadvantage, as determined by the DM.\\n\\t Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelli-\\ngence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a \\nsaving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bo-\\nnus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. \\nSome monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\\n\\t The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by \\nthe effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving \\nthrow allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s \\nspellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\\n\\t The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also \\ndetailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a suc-\\ncessful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or \\nreduced harm, from an effect.\\n66\\n66\\n Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale.

The rules for determining \\ntravel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel \\npace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re \\nmoving over.\\nSpeed\\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in \\n1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic \\nmovement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. \\n\\t The following rules determine how far a character \\nor monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\\nTravel Pace\\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a \\nnormal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace \\ntable. The table states how far the party can move in a \\nperiod of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast \\npace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace \\nmakes it possible to sneak around and to search an area \\nmore carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section \\nlater in this chapter for more information).\\n\\t Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that \\ncharacters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on be-\\nyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\\n\\t For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, \\nthe characters cover the distance shown in the Hour'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='column for their pace, and each character must make a \\nConstitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC \\nis 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving \\nthrow, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see \\nappendix A).\\n\\t Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an \\nhour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. \\nA mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an \\nhour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If \\nfresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters \\ncan cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very \\nrare except in densely populated areas.\\n\\t Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles \\nchoose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne \\nvessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter \\nDelving into the ancient Tomb of Horrors, slipping \\nthrough the back alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh \\ntrail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—these'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='are the things that Dungeons & Dragons adventures \\nare made of.

In a dungeon envi-\\nronment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale \\nof minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down \\na long hallway, another minute to check for traps on \\nthe door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes \\nto search the chamber beyond for anything interesting \\nor valuable.\\n\\t In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='appropriate.

A \\nmarching order makes it easier to determine which char-\\nacters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden \\nenemies, and which ones are the closest to those ene-\\nmies when a fight breaks out.\\n\\t A character might occupy the front rank, one or more \\nmiddle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front \\nand back ranks need enough room to travel side by side \\nwith others in their rank. When space is too tight, the \\nmarching order must change, usually by moving charac-\\nters to a middle rank.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='ters to a middle rank.\\n\\t Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party \\narranges its marching order with only two ranks, they \\nare a front rank and a back rank.

As long as they’re not in the open, they can try \\nto surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. \\nSee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.\\nSplitting Up the Party\\nSometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, \\nespecially if you want one or more characters to scout \\nahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a \\ndifferent speed. Each group has its own front, middle, \\nand back ranks.\\n\\t The drawback to this approach is that the party will be \\nsplit into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. \\nThe advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters \\nmoving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='clumsier characters would alert.

If the adventurers encounter a hostile \\ncreature or group, the DM determines whether the ad-\\nventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat \\nerupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.\\nOther Activities\\nCharacters who turn their attention to other tasks as the \\ngroup travels are not focused on watching for danger. \\nThese characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom \\n(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing \\nhidden threats. However, a character not watching for \\ndanger can do one of the following activities instead, or \\nsome other activity with the DM’s permission.\\n\\t Navigate. The character can try to prevent the group \\nfrom becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide \\nhas rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)\\n\\t Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that \\nrecords the group’s progress and helps the characters \\nget back on course if they get lost. No ability check \\nis required.\\n\\t Track.

(The Dungeon Master’s \\nGuide has rules for foraging.)\\nThe Environment\\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places \\nthat are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be ex-\\nplored. The rules in this section cover some of the most \\nimportant ways in which adventurers interact with the en-\\nvironment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide \\nhas rules covering more unusual situations.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='has rules covering more unusual situations.\\nFalling\\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common haz-\\nards facing an adventurer.\\n\\t At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning \\ndamage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. \\nThe creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage \\nfrom the fall.\\nSuffocating\\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes \\nequal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of \\n30 seconds).\\n\\t When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can \\nsurvive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution \\nmodifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next \\nturn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t re-\\ngain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\\n\\t For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can \\nhold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has \\n2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\\nVision and Light'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Vision and Light\\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing \\ndanger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in com-\\nbat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily \\non a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects \\nthat obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\\n\\t A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a \\nlightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or \\nmoderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wis-\\ndom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\\n\\t A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque \\nfog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature ef-\\nfectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix \\nA) when trying to see something in that area.\\n\\t The presence or absence of light in an environment \\ncreates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim \\nlight, and darkness.\\n\\t Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even \\ngloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='fires, and other sources of illumination within a spe-\\ncific radius.\\n\\t Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly ob-\\nscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary \\nbetween a source of bright light, such as a torch, and sur-\\nrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn \\nalso counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon \\nmight bathe the land in dim light.\\n\\t Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Charac-\\nters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit \\nnights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a sub-\\nterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\\nBlindsight\\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings \\nwithout relying on sight, within a specific radius. Crea-\\ntures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with \\necholocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true \\ndragons, have this sense.\\nDarkvision\\nMany creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a speci-\\nfied range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light \\nas if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim \\nlight, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far \\nas that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t \\ndiscern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\\n69\\n69\\n Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\nTruesight\\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, \\nsee in normal and magical darkness, see invisible \\ncreatures and objects, automatically detect visual il-\\nlusions and succeed on saving throws against them, \\nand perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a \\ncreature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, \\nthe creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\\nFood and Water\\nCharacters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack \\nof food or water can’t be removed until the character eats \\nand drinks the full required amount.\\nFood\\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can \\nmake food last longer by subsisting on half rations. \\nEating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day \\nwithout food.\\n\\t A character can go without food for a number of days \\nequal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum \\n1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character \\nautomatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\\n\\t  A normal day of eating resets the count of days without \\nfood to zero.\\nWater\\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gal-\\nlons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks \\nonly half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Con-\\nstitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at \\nthe end of the day. A character with access to even less \\nwater automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='end of the day.\\n\\t If the character already has one or more levels of ex-\\nhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\\nInteracting with Objects\\nA character’s interaction with objects in an environment \\nis often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the \\nDM that his or her character is doing something, such \\nas moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if any-\\nthing, happens.\\n\\t For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, \\nwhich might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to \\nflood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If \\nthe lever is rusted in position, though, a character might \\nneed to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call \\nfor a Strength check to see whether the character can \\nwrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any \\nsuch check based on the difficulty of the task.\\n\\t Characters can also damage objects with their weap-\\nons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='ons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and \\npsychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by \\nphysical and magical attacks much like creatures can. \\nThe DM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit \\npoints, and might decide that certain objects have resis-\\ntance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard \\nto cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always \\nfail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are \\nimmune to effects that require other saves. When an ob-\\nject drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\\n\\t A character can also attempt a Strength check to break \\nan object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.\\nSocial Interaction\\nExploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slay-\\ning monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less \\nimportant, though, are the social interactions that adven-\\nturers have with other inhabitants of the world.\\n\\t Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to \\nconvince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some mal-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='feasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it \\nwill spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any \\ncharacters who are participating in the interaction that \\ndon’t belong to another player at the table. Any such char-\\nacter is called a nonplayer character (NPC).\\n\\t In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is de-\\nscribed as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs \\nare predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined \\nto get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a \\nfriendly NPC, of course.\\n\\t Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplay-\\ning and ability checks.\\nRoleplaying\\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In \\nthis case, it’s you as a player determining how your char-\\nacter thinks, acts, and talks.\\n\\t Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it \\ncomes to the fore during social interactions. Your charac-\\nter’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how \\ninteractions resolve.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='interactions resolve.\\n\\t There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your \\ncharacter: the descriptive approach and the active ap-\\nproach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. \\nUse whichever mix of the two works best for you.\\nDescriptive Approach to Roleplaying\\nWith this approach, you describe your character’s words \\nand actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on \\nyour mental image of your character, you tell everyone \\nwhat your character does and how he or she does it.\\n\\t For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has \\na quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood \\nfor his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf \\nminstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a con-\\nversation with the dwarf.\\n\\t Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult \\nat the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool \\nand glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”\\n\\t In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude \\nand actions.\\n\\t When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following \\nthings in mind:\\n•\\t Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.\\n•\\t Focus on your character’s intent and how others \\nmight perceive it.\\n•\\t Provide as much embellishment as you feel \\ncomfortable with.\\n70\\n70\\n Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\n\\t Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just fo-\\ncus on thinking about what your character would do and \\ndescribing what you see in your mind.\\nActive Approach to Roleplaying\\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow \\nplayers what your character thinks and does, active role-\\nplaying shows them.\\n\\t When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your \\ncharacter’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might \\neven echo your character’s movements and body language.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='This approach is more immersive than descriptive role-\\nplaying, though you still need to describe things that \\ncan’t be reasonably acted out.\\n\\t Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek \\nabove, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used \\nactive roleplaying:\\n\\t Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, \\n“I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. \\nIf I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm \\nand enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then \\nadds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”\\nResults of Roleplaying\\nThe DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to \\ndetermine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles \\nunder threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let \\nanyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.\\n\\t When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to \\nthe DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and \\npersonality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on \\nthem to influence the NPC’s attitude.\\n\\t Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real \\nlife. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten \\nthem with something they fear, or play on their sympa-\\nthies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything \\nyou want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior \\nor speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or \\ndeceive will fall short.\\nAbility Checks\\nIn addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in deter-\\nmining the outcome of an interaction.\\n\\t Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but \\nthere might still be an element of chance in the situation. \\nFor example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at \\nany point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice \\nto play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other \\nchecks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your \\nDM’s discretion.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='DM’s discretion.\\n\\t Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking \\nof how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the \\ndeck in your favor by using an approach that relies on \\nyour best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a \\nguard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is pro-\\nficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. \\nWhen negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with \\nPersuasion should do most of the talking.\\nResting\\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend \\nevery hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social in-\\nteraction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and \\neat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for \\nspellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. \\n\\t Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short \\nrests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.\\nShort Rest\\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='during which a character does nothing more strenuous \\nthan eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\\n\\t A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end \\nof a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of \\nHit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each \\nHit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds \\nthe character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character \\nregains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The \\nplayer can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after \\neach roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon \\nfinishing a long rest, as explained below.\\nLong Rest\\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 \\nhours long, during which a character sleeps for at least \\n6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light ac-\\ntivity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. \\nIf the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activ-\\nity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin \\nthe rest again to gain any benefit from it.\\n\\t At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost \\nhit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up \\nto a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total \\nnumber of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a \\ncharacter has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four \\nspent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.\\n\\t A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest \\nin a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least \\n1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\\nBetween Adventures\\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient \\nevils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and \\nprepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also \\nuse this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting \\narms and armor, performing research, or spending \\ntheir hard-earned gold.\\n\\t In some cases, the passage of time is something that'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a \\nnew adventure, the DM might simply declare that a cer-\\ntain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe \\nin general terms what your character has  \\nbeen doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep \\ntrack of just how much time is passing as events beyond \\nyour perception stay in motion.\\n71\\n71\\n Chapter 8: Adventuring\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

For example, \\nwhen you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier \\nfor you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live \\nin poverty.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='in poverty.\\nDowntime Activities\\nBetween adventures, the DM might ask you what your \\ncharacter is doing during his or her downtime. Periods \\nof downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime \\nactivity requires a certain number of days to complete \\nbefore you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each \\nday must be spent on the downtime activity for the day \\nto count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you \\nhave more than the minimum amount of days to spend, \\nyou can keep doing the same thing for a longer period \\nof time, or switch to a new downtime activity. \\n\\t Downtime activities other than the ones presented be-\\nlow are possible. If you want your character to spend his \\nor her downtime performing an activity not covered here, \\ndiscuss it with your DM.\\nCrafting\\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventur-\\ning equipment and works of art. You must be proficient \\nwith tools related to the object you are trying to create'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='(typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to \\nspecial materials or locations necessary to create it. For \\nexample, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a \\nforge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\\n\\t For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can \\ncraft one or more items with a total market value not ex-\\nceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth \\nhalf the total market value. If something you want to craft \\nhas a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress \\nevery day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market \\nvalue of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (mar-\\nket value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\n\\t Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward \\nthe crafting of a single item, provided that the charac-\\nters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are \\nworking together in the same place.

The game organizes the chaos of combat \\ninto a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents \\nabout 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each \\nparticipant in a battle takes a turn.

In these \\nsituations, one side of the battle gains surprise over \\nthe other.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the other.\\n\\t The DM determines who might be surprised. If nei-\\nther side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice \\neach other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity \\n(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wis-\\ndom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing \\nside. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a \\nthreat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\\n\\t If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action \\non your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a re-\\naction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be \\nsurprised even if the other members aren’t.\\nInitiative\\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. \\nWhen combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity \\ncheck to determine their place in the initiative order. The \\nDM makes one roll for an entire group of identical crea-\\ntures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\\n\\t The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with \\nthe lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) \\nin which they act during each round. The initiative order \\nremains the same from round to round.\\n\\t If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied \\nDM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the or-\\nder among their tied characters. The DM can decide the \\norder if the tie is between a monster and a player charac-\\nter. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and \\nmonsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest \\nroll going first.\\nYour Turn\\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed \\nand take one action. You decide whether to move first or \\ntake your action first.

The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a \\nrogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action \\nonly when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the \\ngame states that you can do something as a bonus action. \\nYou otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.\\n\\t You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you \\nmust choose which bonus action to use when you have \\nmore than one available.\\n\\t You choose when to take a bonus action during your \\nturn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions \\nalso prevents you from taking a bonus action.\\nChapter 9: Combat\\nCombat Step by Step\\n1.\\tDetermine surprise.

For example, you could open a door during your \\nmove as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your \\nweapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\\n\\t If you want to interact with a second object, you need \\nto use your action. Some magic items and other special \\nobjects always require an action to use, as stated \\nin their descriptions.\\n\\t The DM might require you to use an action for any  \\nof these activities when it needs special care or when it'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM \\ncould reasonably expect you to use an action to open a \\nstuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\\nReactions\\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you \\nto take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is \\nan instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can \\noccur on your turn or on someone else’s.

For \\nexample, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move \\n10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\\nMoving between Attacks\\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon \\nattack, you can break up your movement even further by \\nmoving between those attacks. For example, a fighter \\nwho can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make \\nan attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\\nUsing Different Speeds\\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking \\nspeed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth \\nbetween your speeds during your move. Whenever you \\nswitch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from \\nthe new speed. The result determines how much farther \\nyou can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the \\nnew speed during the current move.\\n\\t For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying \\nspeed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, \\nyou could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into \\nthe air to fly 30 feet more.\\nDifficult Terrain\\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on fea-\\ntureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked \\nforests, treacherous staircases—the setting of \\na typical fight contains difficult terrain.\\n\\t Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in \\na space count as difficult terrain.\\n\\t Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, \\nand shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The \\nspace of another creature, whether hostile or not, also \\ncounts as difficult terrain.\\nBeing Prone\\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, \\neither because they are knocked down or because they \\nthrow themselves down. In the game, they are prone, \\na condition described in appendix A.\\n\\t You can drop prone without using any of your speed. \\nStanding up takes more effort; doing so costs an \\namount of movement equal to half your speed. For ex-\\nample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet \\nInteracting with Objects Around You\\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in \\ntandem with your movement and action:\\n•\\t draw or sheathe a sword\\n•\\t open or close a door\\n•\\t withdraw a potion from your backpack\\n•\\t pick up a dropped axe'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='•\\t pick up a dropped axe\\n•\\t take a bauble from a table\\n•\\t remove a ring from your finger\\n•\\t stuff some food into your mouth\\n•\\t plant a banner in the ground\\n•\\t fish a few coins from your belt pouch\\n•\\t drink all the ale in a flagon\\n•\\t throw a lever or a switch\\n•\\t pull a torch from a sconce\\n•\\t take a book from a shelf you can reach\\n•\\t extinguish a small flame\\n•\\t don a mask\\n•\\t pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\\n•\\t put your ear to a door\\n•\\t kick a small stone\\n•\\t turn a key in a lock\\n•\\t tap the floor with a 10-foot pole\\n•\\t hand an item to another character\\n74\\n74\\n Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

You can’t stand up if you don’t \\nhave enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\\n\\t To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic \\nsuch as teleportation. Every foot of movement while \\ncrawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\\nMoving Around Other Creatures\\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In \\ncontrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space \\nonly if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller \\nthan you. Remember that another creature’s space is dif-\\nficult terrain for you.\\n\\t Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t \\nwillingly end your move in its space.\\n\\t If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, \\nyou provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in \\nthe chapter.\\nFlying Movement\\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but \\nthey must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying \\ncreature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or \\nis otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature \\nfalls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held \\naloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\\nCreature Size\\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The Size Categories table shows how much space \\na creature of a particular size controls in combat. \\nObjects sometimes use the same size categories.\\nSize Categories\\nSize\\nSpace\\nExample Monsters\\nTiny\\n2½ by 2½ ft.\\nImp, sprite\\nSmall\\n5 by 5 ft.\\nGiant rat, goblin\\nMedium\\n5 by 5 ft.\\nOrc, werewolf\\nLarge\\n10 by 10 ft.\\nHippogriff, ogre\\nHuge\\n15 by 15 ft.\\nFire giant, treant\\nGargantuan\\n20 by 20 ft. or larger\\nKraken, purple worm\\nSpace\\nA creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively \\ncontrols in combat, not an expression of its physical di-\\nmensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, \\nfor example, but it does control a space that wide. If a \\nMedium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, \\nother creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin \\nlets them.\\n\\t A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight \\neffectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number \\nof creatures that can surround another creature in com-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='bat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can \\nfit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\\n\\t Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer \\nof them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures \\ncrowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little \\nroom for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Me-\\ndium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large \\nenough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a \\nLarge creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only \\n5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature \\nmust spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and \\nit has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving \\nthrows. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage \\nwhile it’s in the smaller space.\\nActions in Combat\\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one \\nof the actions presented here, an action you gained from'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='your class or a special feature, or an action that you im-\\nprovise. Many monsters have action options of their own \\nin their stat blocks.\\n\\t When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in \\nthe rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible \\nand what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to deter-\\nmine success or failure.\\nAttack\\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack \\naction, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an ar-\\nrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\\n\\t With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. \\nSee the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that gov-\\nern attacks.\\n\\t Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature \\nof the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack \\nwith this action.\\nVariant: Playing on a Grid\\nIf you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures \\nor other tokens, follow these rules.\\n\\t Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.\\n\\t Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot \\nsegments. This is particularly easy if you translate your \\nspeed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, \\na speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.\\n\\t If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in \\nsquares on your character sheet.\\n\\t Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have \\nat least 1 square of movement left, even if the square \\nis diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule \\nfor diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of \\nsmooth play. The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides guidance \\non using a more realistic approach.)\\n\\t If a square costs extra movement, as a square of \\ndifficult terrain does, you must have enough movement \\nleft to pay for entering it. For example, you must have \\nat least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of \\ndifficult terrain.\\n\\t Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\\n\\t Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two \\nthings—whether creatures or objects—start counting \\nsquares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop \\ncounting in the space of the other one. Count by the \\nshortest route.\\n75\\n75\\n Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\nCast a Spell\\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many \\nmonsters, have access to spells and can use them to great \\neffect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which \\nspecifies whether the caster must use an action, a reac-\\ntion, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a \\nspell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells \\ndo have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often \\nuses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See \\nchapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.\\nDash'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='chapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.\\nDash\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra move-\\nment for the current turn. The increase equals your \\nspeed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 \\nfeet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn \\nif you dash.\\n\\t Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this \\nadditional movement by the same amount. If your speed \\nof 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move \\nup to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\\nDisengage\\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t \\nprovoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\\nDodge\\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on \\navoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any \\nattack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can \\nsee the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws \\nwith advantage. You lose this benefit if you are inca-\\npacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed \\ndrops to 0.\\nHelp'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='drops to 0.\\nHelp\\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the com-\\npletion of a task. When you take the Help action, the \\ncreature you aid gains advantage on the next ability \\ncheck it makes to perform the task you are helping with, \\nprovided that it makes the check before the start of your \\nnext turn.\\n\\t Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attack-\\ning a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract \\nthe target, or in some other way team up to make your \\nally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target \\nbefore your next turn, the first attack roll is made with \\nadvantage.\\nHide\\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity \\n(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules \\nin chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain \\nbenefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Tar-\\ngets” section later in this chapter.\\nReady\\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can \\ntake the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act us-\\ning your reaction before the start of your next turn.\\n\\t First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will \\ntrigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you \\nwill take in response to that trigger, or you choose to \\nmove up to your speed in response to it. Examples in-\\nclude “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the \\nlever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I \\nmove away.”\\n\\t When the trigger occurs, you can either take your re-\\naction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. \\nRemember that you can take only one reaction per round.\\n\\t When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold \\nits energy, which you release with your reaction when the \\ntrigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a cast-\\ning time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic \\nrequires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without tak-\\ning effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the \\nweb spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, \\nand if you take damage before you release magic missile \\nwith your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\\nSearch\\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your \\nattention to finding something. Depending on the na-\\nture of your search, the DM might have you make a \\nWisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investiga-\\ntion) check.\\nUse an Object\\nYou normally interact with an object while doing some-\\nthing else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an \\nattack. When an object requires your action for its use, \\nyou take the Use an Object action. This action is also use-\\nful when you want to interact with more than one object \\non your turn.\\nMaking an Attack\\nWhether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a \\nweapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='spell, an attack has a simple structure.\\n1.\\tChoose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s \\nrange: a creature, an object, or a location.\\n2.\\tDetermine modifiers.

In addition, spells, \\nImprovising an Action\\nYour character can do things not covered by the actions in \\nthis chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating \\nenemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or \\ncalling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions \\nyou can attempt are your imagination and your character’s \\nability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in \\nchapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise.\\n\\t When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in \\nthe rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible \\nand what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine \\nsuccess or failure.\\n76\\n76\\n Chapter 9: Combat'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='success or failure.\\n76\\n76\\n Chapter 9: Combat\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0).

You make the attack roll. On a hit, \\nyou roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules \\nthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special \\neffects in addition to or instead of damage.\\n\\t If there’s ever any question whether something you’re \\ndoing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re \\nmaking an attack roll, you’re making an attack.\\nAttack Rolls\\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines \\nwhether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, \\nroll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total \\nof the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s \\nArmor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character \\nis determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='monster is in its stat block.\\nModifiers to the Roll\\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most \\ncommon modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier \\nand the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster \\nmakes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is pro-\\nvided in its stat block.\\n\\t Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee \\nweapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used \\nfor a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that \\nhave the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\\n\\t Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability \\nmodifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcast-\\ning ability of the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10.\\n\\t Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus \\nto your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with \\nwhich you have proficiency, as well as when you attack \\nwith a spell.\\nRolling 1 or 20\\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing \\nthe novice to hit and the veteran to miss.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\\n\\t If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits re-\\ngardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called \\na critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\\n\\t If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses re-\\ngardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.\\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\\nCombatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hid-\\ning, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\\n\\t When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have \\ndisadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether \\nyou’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a \\ncreature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the \\nlocation you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM \\ntypically just says that the attack missed, not whether you \\nguessed the target’s location correctly.\\n\\t When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on \\nattack rolls against it.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='attack rolls against it.\\n\\t If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when \\nyou make an attack, you give away your location when the \\nattack hits or misses.\\nRanged Attacks\\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a \\ncrossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projec-\\ntiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot \\nspines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a \\nranged attack.\\nRange\\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within \\na specified range.\\n\\t If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a \\nsingle range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.\\n\\t Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a long-\\nbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number \\nis the normal range, and the larger number is the long \\nrange. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target \\nis beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target be-\\nyond the long range.\\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a \\nweapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvan-\\ntage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile \\ncreature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.\\nMelee Attacks\\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you \\nto attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically \\nuses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warham-\\nmer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack \\nwhen it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or \\nother body part. A few spells also involve making a me-\\nlee attack.\\n\\t Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus at-\\ntack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee \\nattack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than \\nMedium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 \\nfeet, as noted in their descriptions.\\n\\t Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon \\nattack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count \\nas weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeon-\\ning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are \\nproficient with your unarmed strikes.\\nOpportunity Attacks\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies \\nto drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past \\nyour foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so \\nprovokes an opportunity attack.\\n\\t You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile \\ncreature that you can see moves out of your reach. To \\nmake the opportunity attack, you use your reaction \\nto make one melee attack against the provoking crea-\\nture. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves \\nyour reach.\\n\\t You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by \\ntaking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an \\nopportunity attack when you teleport or when someone \\nor something moves you without using your movement, \\naction, or reaction.

A target has three-quar-\\nters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an \\nobstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow \\nslit, or a thick tree trunk.\\n\\t A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by \\nan attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such \\na target by including it in an area of effect.

Manipulating the fabric of magic and \\nchanneling its energy into even a simple spell is phys-\\nically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are \\neven more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description \\nincludes a table showing how many spell slots of each \\nspell level a character can use at each character level. For \\nexample, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level \\nspell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\\n\\t When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a \\nslot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot \\nwith the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of \\na certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell \\nof higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, \\nbut a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot.

For instance, if Umara casts magic \\nmissile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic mis-\\nsile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the \\nslot it is put into.\\n\\t Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, \\nhave more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as \\ndetailed in a spell’s description.\\nCantrips\\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using \\na spell slot and without being prepared in advance.

The ritual version of a \\nspell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.  \\nIt also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual \\nversion of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.\\n\\t To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a \\nfeature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the \\ndruid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must \\nalso have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells \\nknown, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies oth-\\nerwise, as the wizard’s does.\\nMagic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often \\nappears in the form of a spell.\\n\\t This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. \\nDifferent character classes have distinctive ways of'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='learning and preparing their spells, and monsters \\nuse spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, \\na spell follows the rules here.\\nWhat Is a Spell?\\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of \\nthe magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a \\nspecific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a charac-\\nter carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic \\nsuffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular \\npattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then re-\\nleases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, \\nall in the span of seconds.\\n\\t Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective \\nwards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or re-\\nmove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, \\nand restore life to the dead.\\n\\t Uncounted thousands of spells have been created \\nover the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of \\nthem are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped \\nin the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be re-\\ninvented by a character who has amassed enough power \\nand wisdom to do so.\\nSpell Level\\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a gen-\\neral indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but \\nstill impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredi-\\nble time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells \\nthat characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The \\nhigher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must \\nbe to use that spell.\\n\\t Spell level and character level don’t correspond di-\\nrectly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, \\nnot 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\\nKnown and Prepared Spells\\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have \\nthe spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the \\nspell in a magic item.

The \\nspellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and \\nrecognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters \\nhave varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. \\nBy any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away \\nand inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can’t light'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been \\ntorn.

The spells of wizards, \\nwarlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane \\nmagic. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or \\nintuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks \\ndirectly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired \\neffect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane \\nmagic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers \\nare called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the \\nWeave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces \\nof nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.\\n\\t Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of \\nthe Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='possible.

You can upgrade or \\ndowngrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. \\nAdjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an \\nNPC’s challenge rating.\\n\\t Magic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more \\nlikely it has one or more magic items in its possession. A \\nmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as \\nwell as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC \\na potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its chal-\\nlenge rating. \\n\\t A few magic items are described in chapter 14 of \\nthis document.\\nAcolyte\\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\\nArmor Class 10\\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\\nSpeed 30 ft.\\n\\t\\nSTR\\t\\nDEX\\t\\nCON\\t\\nINT\\t\\nWIS'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Speed 30 ft.\\n\\t\\nSTR\\t\\nDEX\\t\\nCON\\t\\nINT\\t\\nWIS\\t\\nCHA\\n\\t 10 (+0)\\t\\n10 (+0)\\t\\n10 (+0)\\t\\n10 (+0)\\t\\n14 (+2)\\t\\n11 (+0)\\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\\nSenses passive Perception 12\\nLanguages any one language (usually Common)\\nChallenge 1/4 (50 XP)\\nSpellcasting.

Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the ex-\\nperience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the \\nparty. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table has \\nfour XP thresholds for each character level, one for each \\ncategory of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to \\ndetermine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='for every character in the party.\\n\\t 2. Determine the Party’s XP Threshold. For each \\ncategory of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’ \\nXP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP threshold. \\nYou’ll end up with four totals, one for each category of en-\\ncounter difficulty.\\n\\t For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level \\ncharacters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s \\ntotaled XP thresholds would be as follows:\\nEasy: 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)\\nMedium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)\\nHard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)\\nDeadly: 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)\\nRecord the totals, because you can use them for every \\nencounter in your adventure.\\n\\t 3. Total the Monsters’ XP. Add up the XP for all of \\nthe monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP \\nvalue in its stat block.\\n\\t 4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the \\nencounter includes more than one monster, apply a \\nmultiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more monsters'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='there are, the more attack rolls you’re making against the \\ncharacters in a given round, and the more dangerous the \\nencounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s \\ndifficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in \\nthe encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multi-\\npliers table.\\n\\t For example, if an encounter includes four monsters \\nworth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP \\nof the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. \\nThis adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth in \\nterms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help \\nyou accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty.\\n\\t When making this calculation, don’t count any mon-\\nsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the \\naverage challenge rating of the other monsters in the \\ngroup unless you think the weak monsters significantly \\ncontribute to the difficulty of the encounter.\\nEncounter Multipliers\\nNumber of \\nMonsters\\nMultiplier\\n1\\n× 1\\n2\\n× 1.5\\n3–6\\n× 2\\nNumber of'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Multiplier\\n1\\n× 1\\n2\\n× 1.5\\n3–6\\n× 2\\nNumber of \\nMonsters\\nMultiplier\\n7–10\\n× 2.5\\n11–14\\n× 3\\n15 or more\\n× 4\\n\\t 5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters’ adjusted XP \\nvalue to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold that \\nequals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter’s \\ndifficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest threshold \\nthat is lower than the adjusted XP value.\\n\\t For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three \\nhobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it \\na hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters \\nand one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter \\nthreshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of \\n1,400 XP).\\nChapter 13: Building Combat Encounters\\n166\\n166\\n Chapter 13: Building Combat Encounters\\nD&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.\\nParty Size\\nThe preceding guidelines assume that you have a party \\nconsisting of three to five adventurers.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='consisting of three to five adventurers.\\n\\t If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply \\nthe next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers \\ntable. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the \\ncharacters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for \\ngroups of fifteen or more monsters.\\n\\t If the party contains six or more characters, use the \\nnext lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 \\nfor a single monster.\\nMultipart Encounters\\nSometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that \\nthe party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters \\nmight come at the party in waves. For such encounters, \\ntreat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter \\nfor the purpose of determining its difficulty.\\n\\t A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of \\na multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend Hit \\nDice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that re-\\nquire a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher \\nthan one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the \\nadventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the \\nencounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.\\nBuilding Encounters on a \\nBudget\\nYou can build an encounter if you know its desired diffi-\\nculty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget \\nthat you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, \\nhard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups \\nof monsters eat up more of that budget than their base \\nXP values would indicate (see step 4).\\n\\t For example, using the party from step 2, you can build \\na medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted \\nXP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s \\nthreshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 \\nXP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single \\nmonster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or \\nowlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times \\nits base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP \\neach) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a \\nmedium encounter for the party as well.\\n\\t To assist with this approach, appendix B in the Dun-\\ngeon Master’s Guide presents a list of all monsters in \\nthe Monster Manual organized by challenge rating. See \\n“Monsters by Challenge Rating” later in this chapter for a \\nlist by CR of the monsters included in this document.\\nThe Adventuring Day\\nAssuming typical adventuring conditions and average \\nluck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to \\neight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adven-\\nture has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get \\nthrough more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can \\nhandle fewer.\\n\\t In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an en-\\ncounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other \\nopponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='party is likely to progress.\\n\\t For each character in the party, use the Adventuring \\nDay XP table to estimate how much XP that character is \\nexpected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all \\nparty members to get a total for the party’s adventuring \\nday. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP \\nvalue for encounters the party can handle before the \\ncharacters will need to take a long rest.\\nAdventuring Day XP\\nLevel\\nAdjusted XP per Day \\nper Character\\n1st\\n300\\n2nd\\n600\\n3rd\\n1,200\\n4th\\n1,700\\n5th\\n3,500\\n6th\\n4,000\\n7th\\n5,000\\n8th\\n6,000\\n9th\\n7,500\\n10th\\n9,000\\nLevel\\nAdjusted XP per Day \\nper Character\\n11th\\n10,500\\n12th\\n11,500\\n13th\\n13,500\\n14th\\n15,000\\n15th\\n18,000\\n16th\\n20,000\\n17th\\n25,000\\n18th\\n27,000\\n19th\\n30,000\\n20th\\n40,000\\nShort Rests\\nIn general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the \\nparty will likely need to take two short rests, about one-\\nthird and two-thirds of the way through the day.\\nModifying Encounter Difficulty\\nAn encounter can be made easier or harder based on the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='choice of location and the situation.\\n\\t Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step \\n(from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have \\na drawback that their enemies don’t.
